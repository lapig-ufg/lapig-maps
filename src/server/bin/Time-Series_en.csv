MOD16_EVAPOTRANSPIRATION#Real evapotranspiration#Corresponds to actual evapotranspiration in millimeters of water. It is the amount of water that a vegetated surface transfers to the atmosphere. Water may or may not have restriction on the ground.#Água#Water
MOD16_POT_EVAPOTRANSPIRATION#Potential evapotranspiration#The amount of water transferred to the atmosphere of a grassed surface ideal in which there is no hydric restriction of water in the soil and its value depends only on the weather conditions (radiation etc.).#Água#Water
MOD16_NOR_EVAPOTRANSPIRATION#Evapotranspiration Normalized#Actual evapotranspiration divided by potential evapotranspiration, use to normalize the values ET (actual evapotranspiration) to compare two similar types of vegetation located in different places on different weather conditions, ie it is to reduce the locational effect.#Água#Water
